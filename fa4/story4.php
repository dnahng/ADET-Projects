        I challenge any one here to race with me.”
        The Tortoise said quietly, “I accept your challenge.”
        “That is a good joke,” said the Hare; “I could dance round you all the way.”
        “Keep your boasting till you’ve won,” answered the Tortoise. “Shall we race?”
        So a course was fixed and the race started. The Hare darted almost out of sight at once, 
        but soon stopped and, to show his contempt for the Tortoise, lay down to have a nap. 
        The Tortoise plodded on and plodded on, and when the Hare awoke from his nap, he saw 
        the Tortoise just near the finish line and could not run up in time to save the race.";
